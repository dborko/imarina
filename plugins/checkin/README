This plugin is utilized by Cedar Ridge (OneBody's pilot church)
for its very simple child security checkin and attendance system.

It has been pluginized because it is so specialized to Cedar Ridge.

To enable, ruby plugins/checkin/install.rb and navigate to /checkin.

Each person gets extra attributes, including:
* barcode_id     used to reference person when scanned
* checkin_access true/false indicates if person is checkin worker

The following are for informational purposes only. They are displayed
to the checkin workers:
* can_pick_up    text field to indicate people who can pick up this child
* cannot_pick_up text field to indicate who cannot pick up this child
* medical_notes  text field to indicate any medical conditions, allergies, etc.

It is up to you to somehow supply these values to the database.
