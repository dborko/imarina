This is the simple start of a standard OneBody Plugin architecture.

Each directory in the /plugins directory can add routes, models,
views, and controllers to your OneBody installation.

Plugins in this directory (except the Setup plugin) are disabled
by default. To enable, run:

# ruby plugins/checkin/install.rb

Disable by running:

# ruby plugins/checkin/uninstall.rb
