To create your own theme, copy the default "aqueouslight" theme folder
and its contents to a new folder in this location.

Put CSS, JavaScript, Images and other assets in the public/ folder,
in the appropriate location.

The layouts/default.html.erb is the shell of every page displayed
on the site. Creative changes to this file should allow for most
theme design needs.

If, however, you need to edit the guts or look of actual page
content, you may clone the needed structure found in app/views/*
to your theme folder and customize the pages. Only copy the pages
you need to modify, and try to keep your customizations to these
pages to a minimum, as future upgrades may require some TLC if
major changes are made to the HTML.
