<h1>Verify by Mobile Phone</h1>
<p>
  Enter your mobile phone number, select your carrier, then click
  the button below. If we have the number on file, a text message
  will be sent to it allowing you to verify yourself and gain access
  to this site. <strong>Text messaging rates may be charged by your
  carrier. <span class="very-strong">Do not start this verification process until you know
  what you will be charged to receive a text message!</span></strong>
